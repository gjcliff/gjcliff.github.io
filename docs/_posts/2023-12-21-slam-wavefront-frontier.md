**This post is under construction, and will be complete by 12/28/2023**

This package uses frontier exploration and wavefront planning to autonomously drive a differential-drive robot named "nubot"
around its environment, while simultaneously mapping that environment using slam_toolbox. Nav2 is used
to plan paths for nubot.

[Here's some info on wavefront planning](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150IR/labs/wavefront.html)

## Quickstart
1. Clone nubot from https://github.com/m-elwin/nubot into the same workspace as this repository.
2. Build and source the workspace.
3. To have nubot map the environment autonomously, run:
    ```
    ros2 launch nubot_nav explore.launch.xml
    ```
4. To have nubot map the environment manually, with input from you, run:
    ```
    ros2 launch nubot_nav manual_gexplore.launch.xml
    ```

## Description

The simulated robot is mapping an environment and then navigating within the map using the ROS2 slam_toolbox.

The exploration algorithm used is Frontier Exploration: https://web.archive.org/web/202305312...

The Frontier Exploration is supplemented by Wavefront Planning: https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150IR/l...

The map generated by the slam_toolbox is kind of messed up, because for some reason I wasn't able to read messages from the /global_costmap or /local_costmap topics.

Essentially, the wavefront planner will rapidly search the area surrounding the robot. This is visualized by the red dot flying around the screen on the left side of the window. Once the wavefront planner finds some unexplored territory, it will do a slower but more thorough search of the area surrounding the unexplored territory. If there isn't enough unexplored territory in that area, or there are too many walls, then the code will not tell the robot to move there, and will keep searching.

Once some acceptable unexplored territory is found, the robot will plan a path to get there.

The packages used in this ROS2 Iron project are:
- slam_toolbox: https://index.ros.org/p/slam_toolbox/...
- NAV2: https://navigation.ros.org/setup_guid...
